Start the game by clicking the New game 
button located in ActionBar.

Move to right/left by clicking on right/left
side of the Snaky.

Your goal is to eat fruits before Evil Snaky 
eats them. With eating, your score and level 
grows. Don't try to eat a TNT because your 
score will decrease. If Evil Snaky eats it,
two new TNTs appears.

With level growth, the velocity of both snakes 
will increase!

Beware, if you crash into any wall or Evil Snaky, 
you lose.

Good luck !
